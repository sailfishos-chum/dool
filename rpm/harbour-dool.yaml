Description: |
  Dool is a Python3 compatible clone of Dstat.
  After Dag Wieers ceased development of Dstat scottchiefbaker forked the
  project to continue development. Dool is a Python 2.x and 3.x compatible
  version of Dstat with a couple minor bug fixes.
  
  The Description for original dstat follows:
  
  Dstat is a versatile replacement for vmstat, iostat, netstat and ifstat.
  Dstat overcomes some of their limitations and adds some extra features,
  more counters and flexibility. Dstat is handy for monitoring systems
  during performance tuning tests, benchmarks or troubleshooting.
  
  Dstat allows you to view all of your system resources in real-time, you
  can eg. compare disk utilization in combination with interrupts from your
  IDE controller, or compare the network bandwidth numbers directly
  with the disk throughput (in the same interval).
  
  Dstat gives you detailed selective information in columns and clearly
  indicates in what magnitude and unit the output is displayed. Less
  confusion, less mistakes. And most importantly, it makes it very easy
  to write plugins to collect your own counters and extend in ways you
  never expected.
